## Acknowledgement

Please see [Credits](CREDITS.md) for the full list of contributors and/or other factors.

[Diplomacy](https://github.com/DiplomacyTeam/Bannerlord.Diplomacy) was used as the base for this mod but we've stripped all the features out and only kept the config, utils and helpers. We'll probably try and re-add the features from Diplomacy later on down the line.
